# OpenStudio Model

The OpenStudio model needs to be 2.8.1 (at least that is what is used in the simulation node).

Few notes:
* If updating the OpenStudio model, then make sure to update the *Base.osm model. 
* Run the *Base model and then copy the *Base/run/in.osm model to the root directory to be used within Alfalfa.
